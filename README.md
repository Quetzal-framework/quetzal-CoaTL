# C++ Template Libary for coalescence

Quetzal-CoalTL is a C++20 template scientific library for
simulating the coalescence of gene genealogies in explicit landscapes or
phylogenetic networks.

Its aim is to standardize a library of reusable components to encourage
code reuse.

# Documentation

The documentation lives [here](https://quetzal-framework.github.io/quetzal-CoaTL/).

> :egg::egg::egg: If you are not a C++ programmer,
> then you are unlikely to benefit directly from this library:
> you may prefer instead the [Quetzal-EGGS simulators](https://github.com/Quetzal-framework/quetzal-EGGS).
